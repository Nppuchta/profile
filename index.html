        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          Hello, my name is Naomi Puchta! I am a Gnomon Graduate specializing in
          FX, currently based in the Bay Area. My interest in the industry began
          back in high school, doodling characters on a crumpled sheet of paper
          during and between classes. At the same time, I took several computer
          science classes, but eventually found my way into the film and games
          industry. FX brings the best of both worlds, allowing me to express my
          creativity through various mediums while feeding my love for problem
          solving.
        </p>
        <p>
          My passions extend towards modeling, texturing, and sculpting allowing
          me to turn my 2D concepts into 3D environments and lively characters.
          I'm always excited to collaborate with others who share the same
          passion, and I look forward to sharing my work with the world.

        <h3>Breakdown</h3>
        <p>
          This city is inspired by some of the semi futuristic neon city
          artwork I've seen over the years as well as the vibrant nights
          in Tokyo. I took my knowledge in modeling and texturing, and
          created a scene that then could be applied into Houdini to bring
          life to the scene.
        </p>

        <h3>Programs Used</h3>
        <div class="app-icons">

        <div class="illustration-container">
          <div class="illustration-float">
            <img src="portfolio/city-rain/modeling.avif" class="glass">
          </div>
          <p>
            I first began modeling out the buildings, assets, and pathway in
            Maya. Once I was satisfied with the layout I went back in and
            began assembling the UVS. (Human Models were placed in for size
            reference so that when I eventually began running simulations,
            that everything would be roughly the correct scale.)
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Texturing</h3>
        <div class="illustration-container">
          <div class="illustration-float">
            <img src="portfolio/city-rain/texturing.avif" class="glass">
          </div>
          <p>
            Once this was complete, I took each asset into Substance painter
            and began painting on the textures. Each Texture was then loaded
            into Houdini and Rendered out to give an idea what a render would
            look like.
          </p>
        </div>


        <h3>Into Houdini</h3>
        <div class="illustration-container">
          <div class="illustration-float">
            <img src="portfolio/city-rain/houdini.avif" class="glass">
          </div>
          <p>
            Then I began working on the simulations: trickling rain, main rain,
            puddle, splashes, pipe steam, and ground smoke.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Compositing</h3>

          </div>
          <p>
            Since only so much could be done with texturing, I took the final
            renders into nuke to add certain blurs and color grading to achieve
            the final effect!

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          Due to time constraints on the project I did not document progress photos for this project.
          However, while I do not have photos there are still some things I would like to note on this project.
        </p>
        <p>
          The primary challenge when working on this volcanic scene was figuring out a believable way to create flowing lava.
          I scoured across the internet for tutorials on lava, and ended up settling and compiling a few that followed this method:
          The lava's shifting colors was primarily controlled by the velocity the liquid particles. The faster the lava flowed, the brighter
          and hotter the lava, the slower top crust would become darker. To achieve the bubbling lava, I followed a simple tutorial that
          involved adding surface tension to the water and spawning randomized spheres at the bottom of the liquid container that would
          subtract a section of the liquid. Said liquid bubble would then rise up due to the built in engine in Houdini, and the liquid (due
          to the viscosity variables added in the lava) and the bubble would "pop" once it reached the surface. Said tension and bubble size would be
          tweaked and randomized to get 'natural' looking bubbles in the lava. Temperature was also a very important part of this scene, as the top layers controlled
          when lava dripped or popped. This viscosity would rise and decrease the velocity and by result the color of the liquid.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the main troubles I ran into during this project (in part due to time constraint), was that the liquid container would explode or jitter. This was remedied
          by carefully tweaking the velocity and surface tension attributes, though I was never able to figure out exactly why certain values would make the lava break.
        </p>
          The props in the scene were Quixel aquired assets that I retextured to give all rocks a more uniform color and grit. The terrain was a height field modified
          with randomized stones that each had a varying degree of noise and rotation. The volcano terrain was textured in substance painter, with a high detail displacement map baked into a
          low resolution model. The crystal seen on the left was built by making a randomized primary chunk, scattered on a small plane that then had smaller randomized chunks 'cut' out. Some
          displacement and smaller flecks were scattered and randomized on the crystal as well.
        <p>
          Similar to some of the effects used in the raining city, I took certain portions of the terrain and created a randomized black and white noise map that would
          act as the emitter for the smoke. The noise was gradually changing, which allowed for certain parts of the smoke to emit before slowly stopping and disappating.
        </p>
        <p>
          While there are parts of this project I found to be very helpful in my learning, and some parts of the project I like, I would have done certain parts of this project differently
          were I to start from the beginning again. Part of my container issues at the time were due to holes in the geometry, something that would have been fixed if I had focused on
          properly merging the geometry before getting to the liquid. Instead it was a battle of going back and forth, checking and double checking certain parts for gaps or improper normals. In all
          this project gave way to a lot of fun experimentation and fixes that I now carry into my future projects.
        </p>

          <p>
            this was a texturing and modeling project, so I started out
            the process by blocking out the classroom roughly before
            refining and resizing modeled assets.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Texturing</h3>

          </div>
          <p>
            Once this was done I initially finished the project by utilizing
            photoshop and Maya's Vray to render out a completed version of
            the project. Eventually I revisited this project and decided to
            add some atmospheric FX in Houdini.

        <h3>Houdini FX</h3>

          </div>
          <p>
            I began by adding dust and debris into the air before introducing
            a spider web simulation and some falling debris.

          <p>
            Then I Rendered and composited the final scene, utilizing Zdepth,
            light groups, and shadow passes to amplify the detail and mood in
            the original render in Maya.

        <h3>Breakdown</h3>
        <p>
          This is my first ever human head sculpt! This was made during a
          texturing course. The primary sculpt is mostly finished (the first
          'version' of the head having been done in two days with tweaks and
          the addition of hands being added later on.
        </p>
        <p>
          The head and hands are sculpted using the standard tools in Zbrush,
          before being uv-unwrapped and sent to Maya for layout. Afterwards,
          the model was imported into Mari for texturing.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I was fairly new to Mari, there are still some workaround and
          tweaks I'd like to make. But I learned quite a bit through trial and
          error and will take this experience into future character projects.
        </p>

        <h3>Initial Concept</h3>
        <div class="illustration-container">
          <div class="illustration-float">
            <img src="portfolio/octopus-lady/octopus-lady-concept.avif" class="glass">
            <br />
            <img src="portfolio/octopus-lady/octopus-lady-references-transparent.avif" class="glass">
          </div>
          <p>
            I started out with a quick doodle of the concept, mainly focusing on
            getting the base colors for the character as well as the shape language.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the challenges I faced during this point was attempting to
            translate this character concept into a 3D model that was at the
            minimum semi-realistic. On top of this, I was going to be exposed
            to software I was still relatively new to (more specifically Mari)
            so a lot of troubleshooting was inevitable.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Sculpt Progress</h3>
        <div class="illustration-container">
          <div class="illustration-float">
            <img src="portfolio/octopus-lady/sculpt-progress-1.avif" class="glass">
          </div>
          <p>
            This was the first progress of the human sculpt. One setback during this
            process was maintaining human proportions of the cheek, forehead, and
            jaw. I was aiming for a semi-realistic human face, but at this time was
            still struggling with the proportions. This being the first human head
            I've worked on, I added more references of front and side profiles (along
            with some outside instruction/critiques from my professor) in order to
            nail down the face.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="illustration-container">
          <div class="illustration-float">
            <img src="portfolio/octopus-lady/sculpt-progress-2.avif" class="glass">
          </div>
          <p>
            And this was the resulting face after another week (spending roughly 3~
            days working on the refinements). As you'll see during the rest of this
            process, more tweaks were made on the facial sculpt in order to
            complement the incoming texturing (and vice versa).
          </p>
          <p>
            While I wasn't able to make the hair tendrils exactly how I envisioned
            them, I decided it would be better to focus on the face of the sculpt
            rather than the hair.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Texturing Progress</h3>
        <div class="illustration-container">
          <div class="illustration-float">
            <img src="portfolio/octopus-lady/texturing-progress-1a.avif" class="glass">

            <img src="portfolio/octopus-lady/texturing-progress-1b.avif" class="glass">
          </div>
          <p>
            The beginning process of texturing was done through Mari. Most of this
            was initial playing around with the program, where the colors were more
            on the rougher side. I experimented with the stamping skin texture brush
            as is seen here.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="illustration-container">
          <div class="illustration-float">
            <p>
              <strong>Before</strong>
              <img src="portfolio/octopus-lady/texturing-progress-2a.avif" class="glass">
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>After</strong>
              <img src="portfolio/octopus-lady/texturing-progress-2b.avif" class="glass">
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            However, I wasn't necessarily pleased with the original skin texture,
            many parts were patchy or dull. I restarted said skin texturing by deleting
            the original and starting over now that I had more comfortability with the
            tools in the program.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>First Render</h3>
        <div class="illustration-container">
          <div class="illustration-float">
            <img src="portfolio/octopus-lady/render-progress-1.avif" class="glass">
          </div>
          <p>
            This was the first render that I did in Maya, mostly focusing on trying
            to get the skin properly rendered. In this stage I realized the pores and
            lines on the face were being washed out by the subsurface scattering.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this point I had not textured the tentacles on the hair, and was also in
            the process of learning how to apply hair groom (through xgen) to the face
            to create eyebrows, lashes, and face fuzz.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="illustration-container">
          <div class="illustration-float">
            <img src="portfolio/octopus-lady/render-progress-2.avif" class="glass">
          </div>
          <p>
            There were a few iterations in between these two renders, however the main
            notable changes are that the melted makeup was darkened, the tentacles are
            in the process of being textured, and some very minor model changes were made.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the point of writing this, this is my current texturing for the project. I
            plan on making some major tweaks to the tentacles, de-glossing the skin on the
            face, and adding texture to the neck and shoulders (Freckles on the shoulders).
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Extra Assets (Current Progress)</h3>
        <!-- // div class all the way to the img src should be written all together -->
        <div class="illustration-container">
          <div class="illustration-float">

            <!-- // this ^^ -->
          </div>
          <p>
            After taking a look at the scene itself, I started to realize that the renders
            themselves were looking plain (seeing as it was a bust shot with no notable
            jewelry or clothing). So I am modeling a pair of hands to pose and texture to
            make the scene more expressive.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am in the process of texturing said hands (they are already UV'ed) before
            throwing it into the scene with the head.
          </p>

          <p>
            One thing to note is that the headshot will likely end up being a 3/4s view
            as the straight on render is a bit bland.

        <h3>Big Bad Wolf</h3>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <div class="illustration-container">
          <div>

          This sculpt is my second ever completed fullbody sculpture. I attempted
          to go for a more semi-realistic animal face and as such had to look for
          enough images. Nailing down the face took a bit of time, and a lot of
          adjustments in order to get the desired look.

        </p>
      </div>
        <div class="illustration-container">
          <div>
            <img src="portfolio/wolf/Wolf_NOSCENE_Beauty.png" class="glass">
          </div>
        <p>
          The current state of the project is a little past the texturing (something
          I plan on revisiting as I lay down the groom on this wolf to finetune certain
          details like the nose or the creases around the eyes.) One of the main struggles
          was the anatomy on the torso and arms. As I am still fairly new to sculpting,
          creating anatomy that while not fully realistic still follows the general guidelines
          of muscles and joints was quite difficult. With some assistance from my
          professor at the time, I was able to make said adjustments and add my own
          details to the sculpt to make it more interesting to look at. While for
          the most part the sculpt is complete, I do plan on making some adjustments to the face
          as I begin to lay down the fur on the rest of the body. Though having proper anatomy
          and detail on the torso is equally important, due to the density of fur the margin
          of error for certain missing details does not compare when seen alongside the face that
          will have sparser hairs towards the fleshier parts of the face (i.e eyes,nose,lips ear cannal).

        </div>

        <p>
          I started out with some thumbnails of some character designs for the project. I already had a
          character in mind for the project, so the beginning was mainly playing around with silouettes and
          resizing certain parts of the character (I.E the hat). Afterwards I drafted a concept drawing based on the
          thumbnail chosen. Note that while my concept art is very stylized, I already had the intention to go for
          a more semi-realistic piece.
        </p>
      </div>
        <img src="portfolio/wolf/progresspage.png" class="glass">
        <p>
          Above are some progress photos as I began working on the sculpt (mainly just photographing the notable changes in anatomy/proportion as I gained
          more experience in sculpting.) At the time, though now I am quite familiar with Mari, I used substance painter for the texturing and Maya for the uv
          mapping. The eyeballs were an inspired by an old tutorial that I originally followed to make semi cartoonish eyes. However in an old project, one of
          the troubles I had with the eyes was that on a more stylized character these eyes end up looking extremely uncanny. Rather than going for a realistic
          eyeball I instead aimed to lean more on the stylized front. I hand painted the iris and pupil before laying it on a simple eyeball model (taking a sphere and flipping
          and flattening it to shape a proper eye).
        </p>
        <img src="portfolio/wolf/image_2024_12_03T04_04_45_945Z.png" class="glass">
        <p>
          As you can see on the mouth that has been painted, I textured the gums, teeth, and lips seperately. This may be subject to change in the future as I find (similarly with
          the tongue and texture on the hat monster) that there is a fine line between too realistic or too cartoonish that I need to make adjustments to. The current plan for
          this project is to begin taking it into maya for xgen, working on the lower and upper body of the wolf groom. I plan to make adjustments to the face sculpt and hands so that
          when I begin to place separate grooms on those pieces that the fur/model can be adjusted quickly back and forth in order to get the density and pattern I am looking for.
          While I do have clothes in the original reference, for the time being I plan on fully grooming the body and possibly revisiting/renewing this project at a later date once
          I am more familiar with programs like Marvelous.
